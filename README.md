# Makers Final PROJECT 
## I'm In (i-min.co.uk )
### A.K.A Project Snowflake

##Â The Concept

Many people like the idea of giving back to the local community, but aren't able to commit to a long term role or don't know where to look.

"I'm In" serves as a platform to link up people who want to give back to their community with one-off opportunities to do so (think clearing up the local park, helping out at a food bank for a day, etc.).  

A user can list projects and also volunteer for projects. Projects are displayed on a map allowing a user to select accessible projects. 

The site also incorporates a crowdsourcing element, with project organisers setting a minimum number of volunteers required for the project to go ahead.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the app, and run these command line requests:

```
  git clone https://github.com/wirsindpapst/project-snowflake
  cd project-snowflake
  meteor run
```

2. Enter 'localhost:3000' into your preferred browser to load the site
